This is the starter code project for the `Demo 2` project in CMPM 121, Game
Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should
incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git.

User can draw on the canvas and they can as well place stickers. They can input their own stickers with "add cutom sticker" button. Th program can change the color of the pen as well as the thickness of the brush. Every time the user changes stickers, the sticker changes rotation. User can also export drawing as a png.
